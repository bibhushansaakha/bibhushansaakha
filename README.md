Bibhushan Saakha
=================

*A Creative Mind paired with an Enthusiastic Soul, I thrive by learning to work and working to learn.* âœ¨

I have a passion for technology and programming ðŸ’», so I pursue a Computer Engineering Degree at Kathmandu University. I also love art and design ðŸŽ¨ and try to incorporate them into my work as a UI designer/ Graphic Designer. 

I have always been a critical thinker ðŸ§ . I enjoy problems that require deep thought and analysis. From Chess to a National Record in Blindfolded Cube Solving. 

I am excited to continue learning and creating solutions! ðŸ¤©ðŸŽ‰
